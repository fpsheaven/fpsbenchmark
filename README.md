# CSGO FPS BENCHMARK
Benchmark your CSGO frames via this tool. Massive thank you to MrMaxim https://www.youtube.com/@MrMaxim and samisalreadytaken for his DUST2 benchmark https://github.com/samisalreadytaken/csgo-benchmark  and for laying the foundation for me to create these tests


Choose which map you want to benchmark, download the RAR file from github and paste the "csgo" folder inside your CSGO directory.

Mine for example is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive" 

Then,open console and type "map de_ancient or map de_anubis"

Lastly,type "exec benchmark" and then "benchmark". The test lasts approx 1min,so be patient.
