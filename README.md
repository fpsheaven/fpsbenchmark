Benchmark your CSGO frames via this tool. Massive thank you to MrMaxim https://www.youtube.com/@MrMaxim and samisalreadytaken https://github.com/samisalreadytaken/csgo-benchmark  for laying the foundation for me to create this tool.


Download the ZIP from github and paste the "csgo" folder inside your CSGO directory.
Mine is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive" 
Open console and type "map de_ancient"
Then,type "exec benchmark" and lastly "benchmark". The test lasts approx 1min,so be patient.
